# Ralphex

Ralphex is a specs-first CLI for running iterative coding loops against external agent CLIs such as OpenCode, Claude Code, and Cursor. It gives you built-in `plan` and `build` prompts, deterministic configuration precedence, and a simple command model that works well in repository-driven workflows.

It wraps a supported agent CLI in a repeatable loop: resolve a prompt, run the agent, and repeat until the agent emits `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` or max iterations is reached. Each pass works against the updated repository, which makes it a good fit for specs, implementation plans, and repository-local prompts.

> [!NOTE]
> The repository is `iyaki/ralphex`, but the CLI command remains `ralph`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ralphex does not bundle an agent runtime. Install and authenticate a supported agent CLI separately, then make sure its binary is available on your `PATH`.

## Why Ralphex

- Runs a repeatable prompt loop until the agent signals completion or max iterations is reached.
- Supports built-in `build` and `plan` prompts plus inline, stdin, and file-based prompts.
- Applies predictable precedence across flags, environment variables, config files, and prompt front matter.
- Keeps repository-specific prompts and local overrides easy to manage.
- Fits the Ralph Wiggum style of specs-first development.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Binary |
| --- | --- |
| Oh My Pi | `omp` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` |
| Claude Code | `claude` |
| Cursor | `cursor` |

**Codex, Copilot, Gemini, and more agents, coming soon**

`model` and `agent-mode` are forwarded when the selected agent CLI supports them.

### Adding Support for New Agents

Agent support Pull Requests are always welcomed. To add or update agent integrations, follow the workflow in [`CONTRIBUTING.md` ("Adding Support for a New Agent")](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-support-for-a-new-agent):

1. `agent-spec-creation` for spec definition
2. `agent-implementation` for TDD-based code changes

</details>

## Install

Requirements:

- A supported agent CLI in `PATH`
- Go `1.25` if you are building from source

Prebuilt binaries are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/iyaki/ralphex/releases). The latest release page is https://github.com/iyaki/ralphex/releases/latest.

Devcontainer feature:

`ghcr.io/iyaki/devcontainer-features/ralph:1`

Build from source:

```bash
make build
./bin/ralph --help
```

Run directly from source without building:

```bash
make run ARGS='--help'
```

Install system-wide after building:

```bash
make install
```

For a reproducible local environment, open the repository with the included dev container in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

## Quick Start

If you are already doing spec-driven development:

```bash
# Create a starter config
ralph init

# Generate or refresh the implementation plan for a scope
ralph plan authentication

# Run the default build loop
ralph

# Run the same default loop through the explicit entrypoint and prompt name
ralph run build

# Use a different agent for one run
ralph --agent claude --model claude-sonnet-4 build
```

Common prompt entrypoints:

```bash
# Inline prompt text
ralph --prompt "Review the repository and summarize the highest-risk area"

# Prompt from stdin
printf 'Prompt from stdin' | ralph -

# Prompt from a file with an explicit prompt name
ralph --prompt-file ./prompts/review.md review

# Per-run child agent environment override
ralph --env HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8080 build
```

## Command Model

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `ralph` | Equivalent to `ralph run build` |
| `ralph run [prompt] [scope]` | Explicit loop entrypoint |
| `ralph <prompt> [scope]` | Alias to `ralph run <prompt> [scope]` when `<prompt>` is not a subcommand |
| `ralph init` | Generate a starter config file |
| `ralph run init` | Run a prompt named `init` |

Useful examples:

```bash
# Built-in planning prompt
ralph plan payment-service

# Explicit run command
ralph run build

# Inline prompt text
ralph --prompt "Review the repository and summarize the highest-risk area"

# Prompt from stdin
printf 'Prompt from stdin' | ralph -

# Prompt from a file with an explicit prompt name
ralph --prompt-file ./prompts/review.md review

# Per-run child agent environment override
ralph --env HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8080 build
```

### `ralph init`

`ralph init` currently writes a starter config with repository-friendly defaults. It requires an interactive terminal, writes to `./ralph.toml` by default, and fails if the target already exists unless `--force` is set.

```bash
ralph init
ralph init --output ./team/ralph.toml
ralph init --force
```

The generated starter config disables logging by default (log file is empty). Users can enable logging during the interactive questionnaire by providing a log file path. The default prompts directory is set to `.ralph/prompts` so prompt files can live inside the repository.

## Prompt Resolution

Prompt content is resolved in this order:

1. `--prompt`
2. stdin via `ralph -` or `--prompt-file -`
3. `--prompt-file <path>`
4. `<prompts-dir>/<prompt>.md`, searched upward from the current directory when `prompts-dir` is relative
5. Built-in `build` and `plan` prompts

If `prompts-dir` is an absolute path, Ralphex checks that exact path instead of walking parent directories.

Markdown prompt files can include YAML front matter for `model` and `agent-mode` overrides:

```md
---
model: claude-sonnet-4
agent-mode: planner
---

Review the repository, compare it against the specs, and update the plan.
```

Front matter is stripped before the prompt body is sent to the agent.

For `model` and `agent-mode`, effective precedence is:

```text
flags > environment variables > prompt front matter > [prompt-overrides.<prompt>] > global config
```

## Configuration

Ralphex resolves settings with this precedence:

```text
flags > environment variables > config file > defaults
```

### Config Files and Local Overlays

Base config selection happens in this order:

1. `--config <path>`
2. `RALPH_CONFIG`
3. `./ralph.toml` in the current directory

If a base config file is selected, a sibling `ralph-local.toml` is merged over it before environment variables and flags are applied. This lets you commit shared defaults in `ralph.toml` and keep machine-specific overrides untracked in `ralph-local.toml`.

For example, `--config ./team/ralph.toml` loads `./team/ralph-local.toml` if it exists. It does not look for `./ralph-local.toml` in the current working directory.

`[env]` entries and `[prompt-overrides.<prompt>]` entries merge by key across `ralph.toml` and `ralph-local.toml`. Parse errors in either file stop the run before the agent starts.

> [!TIP]
> Keep shared team defaults in `ralph.toml`, add `ralph-local.toml` to `.gitignore`, and use the local file for personal overrides and secrets.

Example `ralph.toml`:

```toml
agent = "opencode"
model = "gpt-5"
max-iterations = 30

specs-dir = "specs"
specs-index-file = "README.md"
implementation-plan-name = "IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md"
prompts-dir = ".ralph/prompts"

no-log = false
log-file = "./ralph.log"

[prompt-overrides.plan]
agent-mode = "planner"

[env]
HTTP_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RALPH_CONFIG` | Select the base config file path |
| `RALPH_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Override `max-iterations` |
| `RALPH_SPECS_DIR` | Override `specs-dir` |
| `RALPH_SPECS_INDEX_FILE` | Override `specs-index-file` |
| `RALPH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_NAME` | Override `implementation-plan-name` |
| `RALPH_CUSTOM_PROMPT` | Provide inline prompt text, similar to `--prompt` |
| `RALPH_LOG_FILE` | Override the log file path |
| `RALPH_LOG_ENABLED` | Boolean: `1` or `true` enables logging, `0` or `false` disables it |
| `RALPH_LOG_APPEND` | Boolean: `1` or `true` appends, `0` or `false` truncates on start |
| `RALPH_PROMPTS_DIR` | Override `prompts-dir` |
| `RALPH_AGENT` | Select the agent: `opencode`, `claude`, or `cursor` |
| `RALPH_MODEL` | Override `model` |
| `RALPH_AGENT_MODE` | Override `agent-mode` |

If `prompts-dir` is unset everywhere, the runtime default is `$HOME/.ralph`. The starter config written by `ralph init` pins `prompts-dir` to `.ralph/prompts` so prompt files live in the repository.

### Child Agent Environment

Ralphex's own `RALPH_*` settings are separate from the environment passed to the child agent. Use `[env]` in config for shared values and repeatable `--env KEY=VALUE` flags for per-run overrides.

Child agent environment precedence is:

```text
inherited environment < [env] in config < repeated --env flags
```

Later `--env` flags win for the same key. Each flag entry must use `KEY=VALUE`, and keys must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

### Logging

With no config file, logging is disabled by default. When logging is enabled and no explicit path is configured, the effective default log file is `./ralph.log` in the current working directory.

Logs mirror stdout and are written with `0600` permissions. Each run starts with a header that includes a timestamp plus git branch and commit metadata; unresolved git values are recorded as `N/A`.

```bash
# Enable logs for one run even if config disables them
ralph --no-log=false --log-file ./ralph.log build

# Start from an empty log file
ralph --no-log=false --log-file ./ralph.log --log-truncate build

# Same behavior through environment variables
RALPH_LOG_ENABLED=1 RALPH_LOG_APPEND=0 ralph build
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Prompt text and agent output are written to stdout and, when logging is enabled, to the configured log file. Treat prompt files, config overrides, and logs as sensitive.

## Workflow

Ralphex is designed around a specs-first loop inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's [Ralph methodology](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/).

Typical flow:

1. Define or refine requirements in `specs/`.
2. Run `ralph plan <scope>` to generate or update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
3. Run `ralph` or `ralph build` to implement the next task.
4. Repeat until the agent returns the completion signal.

The built-in prompts use a `<COMPLETION_SIGNAL>` placeholder, which Ralphex replaces with `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` before sending the prompt to the agent.

## Spec Creator Skill

This repo includes the `spec-creator` [skill](https://agentskills.io/home) (see [.agents/skills/spec-creator/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/spec-creator/SKILL.md)) for the first phase of Geoffrey Huntley's Ralph Wiggum methodology.

To install it using Vercel's skills CLI, run:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/iyaki/ralphex/ --skill spec-creator
```
